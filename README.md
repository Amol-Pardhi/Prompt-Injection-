# Prompt Injection Detection

This repository addresses prompt injection in AI systems using machine learning!

## Overview

- Classifies prompts as either safe or containing injection attempts.
- Trains a machine learning model to identify malicious features in prompts.
- Utilizes techniques such as n-grams and ML models for detection.
- Enhances the security of large language models (LLMs) and generative AI systems.
